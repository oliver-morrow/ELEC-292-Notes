A `JOIN` is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on related columns between them.
# Types of SQL Joins
## INNER JOIN
`INNER JOIN` returns records that have matching values in both tables.
## LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
`LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
## RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
`RIGHT JOIN` returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
## FULL (OUTER) JOIN
`FULL JOIN` returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.


Given $$J=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(f(x_{i})-y_{i})^2$$
and $$f(x_{i})=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(w_{0}+w_{1}x_{1})}}$$
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial w_{1}}\left( \frac{1}{1+e^{-(w_{0}+w_{1}x_{1})}} \right)$$

Simplify $$w_{1}=w_{1}-\frac{\alpha}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left[ \left( \frac{1}{1+e^{-(w_{0}+w_{1}x_{1}}}-y_{i} \right) \right]$$
