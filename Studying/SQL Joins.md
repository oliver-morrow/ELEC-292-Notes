A `JOIN` is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on related columns between them.
# Types of SQL Joins
## INNER JOIN
`INNER JOIN` returns records that have matching values in both tables.
## LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
`LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
## RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
`RIGHT JOIN` returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
## FULL (OUTER) JOIN
`FULL JOIN` returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
